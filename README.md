Installation Guide
==============

The only requirements to build this are SDL3, SDL-mixer, and the ability to compile C++17 (with standard library)

Just run 

```
cmake .
make
```

Currently, you need to modify the code yourself to add a rom, when the emulator is working with at least a few games, I'll modify it so you can feed it in roms like a command line utility.
